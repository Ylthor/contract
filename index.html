The Customer may not require the Contractor to perform extra or change-order work without providing written authorization prior to the commencement of any Work covered by the applicable Change-Order. Extra work or a change-order is not enforceable against a Customer unless the Change-Order also identifies all of the following in writing prior to the commencement of any work covered by the applicable Change-Order: the scope of the work encompassed by the order, the amount to be added or subtracted from the contract; and the effect the order will make in the progress payments or the completion date. Contractor’s failure to comply with Change Order non-material requirements may not preclude the recovery of compensation for work performed based on legal or equitable remedies designed to prevent unjust enrichment. </li>
<!--      page5 -->
      <li><span class="li-cap">3.2</span>In the event that unforeseen conditions are discovered by the Contractor during the Project, the Contractor will issue a Change Order for Customer's review and signature. The Customer agrees to respond to the change order within 24 hours. Should the Customer fail to respond to a Change Order within the specified time frame, the Customer agrees to be held fully responsible for any and all financial losses that it causes to the Contractor and any/all parties involved in the completion of Work under this Agreement, this especially applies in cases when an initiated Change Order is preventing the Contractor from continuing the Work under this Agreement and/or not completing as much work as was planned by the Contractor.

    <b>Materials</b>
    <ul class="ns-ul">
      <li><span class="li-cap">5.1</span>After this Agreement is signed the Contractor will provide a list of proposed decoration (finish) materials to the Customer for review and to make selection. The Customer agrees to use reasonable efforts to respond to the list of materials within 5 days from the date it was provided by the Contractor. When the Customer approves one of the proposed material options for an item - that item will automatically be moved to the "Approved Material List".
</li>
      <li><span class="li-cap">5.2</span>When all materials are selected and approved by the Customer for all items, the Contractor will create a Change Order which will indicate the total cost of materials plus the service fee (referenced in this Agreement under section 5.3.). The Customer agrees to make the payment that will be listed in that change order within 7 days from Customer’s receipt of the Change Order. As soon as the payment is received by the Contractor - the Contractor will order all selected materials for delivery directly to the storage space. Ordering materials before the work begins prevents the risk of some materials being out of stock and/or being no longer available. This also ensures that all materials are delivered and quality-checked by the Contractor before the Project's start date. </li>

      <li><span class="li-cap">5.4</span>If The Customer wishes to exchange or cancel any item or material that was ordered by the Contractor under this Agreement or any additional work order (Change Order), the 25% service fee billed for such item will not be refunded.

      <li><span class="li-cap">9.2</span>For a period of one (1) year from the date services were first provided, the Contractor will provide replacement services for any defectively performed service with the exception of any work related to Customer-Provided Materials.
